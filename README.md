### This fork contains modificaitons for passing a qptiff file as input

 ```python CommandSingleCellExtraction.py --masks ../../Mask.tif --channel_names ../../Markers.csv --image ../../xyz.qptiff --output ../../Documents/xyz```
 
# Single cell quantification
Module for single-cell data extraction given a segmentation mask and multi-channel image. The CSV structure is aligned with histoCAT output.

**CommandSingleCellExtraction.py**:

* `--masks` Paths to where masks are stored (Ex: ./segmentation/cellMask.tif) -> If multiple masks are selected the first mask will be used for spatial feature extraction but all will be quantified

* `--image` Path to image(s) for quantification.  (Ex: ./registration/*.h5) -> works with .h(df)5 or .tif(f)

* `--output` Path to output directory. (Ex: ./feature_extraction)

* `--channel_names` csv file containing the channel names for the z-stack (Ex: ./my_channels.csv)

* `--mask_props` Space separated list of additional metrics to be calculated for every mask.
    This is intended for metrics that depend only on the cell mask. If the metric depends
    on signal intensity, use `--intensity-props` instead.
    See list at https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#regionprops

* `--intensity_props` Space separated list of additional metrics to be calculated for every marker separately.
    By default only mean intensity is calculated.
    If the metric doesn't depend on signal intensity, use `--mask-props` instead.
    See list at https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#regionprops
    Additionally available is gini_index, which calculates a single number
    between 0 and 1, representing how unequal the signal is distributed in each region.
    See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient. For example, to calculate the median intensity, specify `--intensity_props median_intensity`.
